# Point-eAutomatedFlow
Using OpenAI's Point-e repository to automate text-to-3D object workflow. This includes a tutorial on how to convert user-inputted text into a nbx file mesh and then into a fully baked fbx file for use in game engines. NOTE: Code for Automation is still in progress 

## Requirements: 
1. Install Python 3.* if you do not yet have python.
3. Clone OpenAI's point-e repository and follow all installation requirements
4. If you are running jupyter notebook files locally:
    1. It is highly recommended that you have a viable GPU available and install Tensorflow and its dependencies. Alternative options include running the notebooks on Google Colab or on a cloud service such as Azure. Tensorflow: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip
    2. Install Anaconda or Miniconda. Create a new environment with Tensorflow's packages and switch to the environment.   
5. Install Blender 3.6. The version is very important because different versions of Blender support different types of baking. 
6. Install your 3D Simulation Engine of your choice. Typically these will be Unity, Unreal Engine, or Godot. 

## Instructions: 
Automatic:
(WIP) Run ProgramHandler.py

Manual:
1. (If running locally) Run Anaconda and switch to your Tensorflow environment if you haven't already done so.
3. Run text2pointcloud.ipynb
4. Run pointcloud2mesh.ipynb
5. In the script ply_to_fbx.py, specify the path to your .ply file.
6. Run the command "Python ply_to_fbx.py". This will create a fbx file from the ply  

Baking settings are based on these intrusctions: https://betterprogramming.pub/from-text-to-unreal-engine-object-using-openais-new-3d-model-generator-65e5b1019045 . Note that Unreal Engine is the final engine in the tutorial where the fbx file gets imported.
